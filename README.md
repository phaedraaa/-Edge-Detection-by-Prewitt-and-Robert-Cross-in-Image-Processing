# Edge Detection by Prewitt and Robert Cross in Image Processing

 Implemented and optimized edge detection algorithms (Prewitt, Roberts Cross) in C for YUV 4:4:4 images,
 focusing on performance improvement through loop transformations, memory buffers, and hierarchical
 memory(ROM,RAM,Cache). Conductedexperiments with ARMulator to evaluate memory management
 strategies and performance metrics, achieving efficient execution in low-power embedded systems
